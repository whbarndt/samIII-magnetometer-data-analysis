# samIII-magnetometer-data-analysis
Python scripts to parse the data of an implementation of a Simple Aurora Monitor (SAM-III) magnetometer and create datasets that are able to be analyzed to science-grade magnetometers apart of the Geophyisical Institute Magnetometer Array (GIMA). Also including a yearly scientific and operational analysis using sunspot numbers and subsurface temperatures respectively to better understand the SAM-III dataset.
